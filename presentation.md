## Problem Statement  

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):**  
  - Find the shortest Hamiltonian circuit in a weighted, complete graph.  
  - NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem.  

- **Hamiltonian Circuit:**  
  - Path visiting each node once, with same start and end.  

- **Goal:** Minimize the total weight of the path.

## Benchmark Datasets  

- Benchmarks for TSP:  
  - Source: [TSPLIB Dataset Repository](https://github.com/mastqe/tsplib/tree/master).

## Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) Basics  

- **Core Idea:**  
  - Multiple agents (ants) independently explore paths.  

- **Movement:**  
  - Based on heuristic information (inverse of edge weight).  
  - Influenced by pheromone trails left by ants of previous steps.  

- **Balance:**  
  - **Exploration:** Probabilistic movement ensures diverse solutions.  
  - **Exploitation:** Heuristic edge costs and pheromones improve efficiency.

---

## Implemented Algorithm – Design  

- **Graph Representation:**  
  - Used `networkx` for graph management.  

- **Implemented Classes:**  
  - `TSP`: Manages algorithm parameters.  
  - `Path`: Generates solutions and manages graph and pheromone matrix with class attributes shared by all `Path` instances, to improve efficiency and memory management.  

- **Initial Pheromone Matrix:**  
  - Initialized as \(1/\text{heuristic cost}\) to smooth updates. 
  Heuristic cost estimated as the cost of a path generated by heuristic information only.

---

## Algorithm Refinements  

- **Gradual Updates to Coefficients:**  
  - Decreasing `alpha` (heuristic weight) and increasing `beta` (pheromone weight) after certain steps for better learning.  

- **Handling Numerical Issues:**  
  - Reset coefficients when probabilities become NaN.  
  - Ensure comparability between pheromone and heuristic scales.  

- **Probability Calculation:**  
  - Separate computation for pheromone and heuristic contributions.

---

## Experiments and Findings  

- **Elitism:** Using only the best half of paths for updates – minimal improvement.  
- **Biasing Pheromones with Best Path:** No significant benefit.  
- **2-Opt Algorithm:**  
  - Enhanced solution quality significantly when combined with ACO.  
  - Occasionally found optimal solutions.

---

## Parallel Considerations

- **Independence of Agents:**  
  - Each agent (ant) works independently, making parallel processing feasible.  

- **Parallel Strategy:**  
  - Agents access shared graph/pheromone matrix and communicate results to the master process.  
  - Suitable for large graphs where generating a path may be time consuming.

---

## Conclusion  

- The implemented ACO algorithm effectively solves TSP.  
- Achieves sufficiently good solutions quickly compared to exhaustive search (\(n!\) complexity).  
- Effective parameter management and optimisation techniques improve solution quality.  
- Potential for parallel scalability in large-scale problems.
